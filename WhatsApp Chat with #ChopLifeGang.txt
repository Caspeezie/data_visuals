10/8/20, 1:24 PM - Cupcake CLG: *HOW TO AVOID SUDDEN DEATH DURING SEX (Advise to Men).*

Pls beware of these killer commands do not, I REPEAT, do not obey them:

(1) Harder!Harder!!
(2) Jack it Man!
(3) Hit it deep!
(4) Faster!Faster!!
(5) Don't stop!
(6) It's your own scatter it!

You see eh my brother, women's work is always in progress you can't finish it. Somebody did it to the point you met it, don't try to be a HERO bro.

In the event of your sudden death, someone else will continue the work. A word is enough for the wise.

Remember, the *PISTLE* damages faster than the *MORTAR....*☹️

*Be Warned*🚶🏿‍♂️🚶🏿‍♂️🚶🏿‍♂️🚶🏿‍♂️

10/11/20, 8:34 AM - Vynze Cent: *IN 1980 NIG. EXCHANGED 80kobo to 1$*
*TODAY NIG. EXCHANGES ₦470 to 1$*

*BUT HERE ARE THE MAJOR REASONS AS CAPTURED BY AN ANONYMOUS WRITER.*

*We shouldn't be surprised.*

*We were far more productive in 1980 than we are today*

*In 1980 the key reasons for economic growth were are as follows:*

*1) We were a net exporter of refined petroleum products. Today we import all our refined petroleum products.*

*2) We rode in locally assembled cars, buses and trucks. Peugeot cars in Kaduna and Volkswagen cars in Lagos.*

*Leyland in Ibadan and ANAMCO in Enugu produced our buses and trucks.*

*Steyr at Bauchi producing our Agricultural tractors.* 

*And it was not just Assembly, we were producing many of the components.* 

*Vono products in Lagos producing the seats.*
 
*Exide in Ibadan producing the batteries, not just for Nigeria but for the entire West Africa.*

*Isoglass and TSG in Ibadan producing the windshields.*

*Ferodo in Ibadan producing the brake pads and discs*

*Tyres produced by Dunlop in Lagos and Mitchelin in Portharcourt.* 

*And I mean tyres produced from rubber plantations located in Rivers State.*

*3) We were listening to Radio and watching television sets assembled in Ibadan by Sanyo.*

*4) We were using refrigerators, freezers and Airconditioners produced by Thermocool.*

*5) We were putting on clothes produced from the UNTL textile mills in Kaduna and Chellarams in Lagos.* 

*Not from imported cotton but from cotton grown in Nigeria.*

*6) Our water was running through pipes produced by Kwalipipe in Kano.*

*7) Our toilets were fitted with WC produced at Kano and Abeokuta.*

*😎 We were cooking with LPG gas stored inside gas cylinders produced at the NGC factory in Ibadan.*

*9) Our electricity was flowing through cables produced by the Nigerian wire and Cable, Ibadan and Kablemetal in Lagos and Portharcourt.*

*10) We had Bata and Lennards producing the shoes we were putting on*
*Not from imported leather but from locally tanned leather at Kaduna.*

*11) We were mainly flying our airways, the Nigeria Airways, to most places in the world.* 
*The Airways was about the biggest in Africa at that time.*

*12) Most of the food we ate were being grown or produced in Nigeria*.

*We were producing all of the above and more in 1980*

*Today, we import almost everything.*

*There lies the source of the terrible exchange rate we are experiencing today and everybody reading this has a critical role to play in reversing this very UGLY trend.*
 
*It is not enough for us to complain about the exchange rate or point out what others are not doing or are failing to do, the key question is what are we producing or what are we planning to produce?*

*Going forward, it's time to ponder and think of the way forward progressivesly before it's TOO LATE.*

*Credit goes to the Unknown writer for this beautiful reminder.*

*We have been talking about these problems and more for ages... what solutions do we have in mind?

10/12/20, 2:21 PM - Ninah CLG: 1. In that situation they clearly didn't want to have any meeting with him because he was identified as a protester and if he had claimed to be a protester, they would call him the leader, so he applied what he thought was right at that point to make them continue the meeting
10/12/20, 2:22 PM - Ninah CLG: 2. He didn't go there to protest.... Did you hear him shouting or carrying any placard???? .. because he went after the press release that they have ended SARS ....he went for the release of the protesters
3. Maybe you should follow up the news well before jumping into conclusion

10/12/20, 2:31 PM - Caspeezie: He isn't the face of the protest and wasn't the wisest choice behind going for that meeting... He should've armed himself with smarts and wits not 'my media team's.. Anyways kudos to his efforts but I don't stand with him on this action he took

Since last night he tweeted it that he will be meeting igp and asked anybody to join him. Where are other celebrities? Where are all the popular youths living in abuja?

But all of them dey house dey tweet. This one get malaria, this other one get covid 19. 

Omo, let's cut David some slack please. He's doing his best for the youths
10/12/20, 2:52 PM - Abdul Xzeecool: I no blame him at all sha, he's just a celebrity probably never in this kind of situation b4
10/12/20, 3:01 PM - Abdul Xzeecool: But he said he wasn't the face since yesterday na, was even asking people to come and join him to the meeting

I don't get the point that some people will bring in their our bla bla bla mind and yarn okoto. From my own point of view oooo.


The coming together of Nigerian youth  to chase a goal at a time is best 

Why would you bring up another stuff 

It's not that I'm saying it's wrong buh lets achieve one first or una won't make we loose both goals.

And ending rape those wey dey rape register w Govt?

Those kidnapping people register w Govt?

Buh this SARS is something the Govt can disolve within a minute. 

I come in peace

And that from my own point of view oo

10/12/20, 3:50 PM - Lamba CLG: I come in peace too

You have a point and she also has apoint. Trending one issue or multiple issues would still serve the purpose if we are thinking as one Nigeria. To me oo, I don't think is a competition between the north and the south, I think it should be viewed as collective protest for a better Nigeria. If we are thinking as one Nigeria all this hashtag for end this and end that needs to be ended regardless of the region.

I leave in peace
10/12/20, 3:50 PM - Lamba CLG: And we also have people with myopic thinking every where🤦🏾‍♂️
10/12/20, 3:52 PM - Ninah CLG: Lol. Did she say something wrong
10/12/20, 3:52 PM - Ninah CLG: Ok
10/12/20, 3:53 PM - Abdul Xzeecool: I think they are doing it the wrong way, raising it now will definitely paint to it being like a competition.

10/12/20, 4:04 PM - Lamba CLG: Nah,I didn't comprehend the tweet wepo at first, my bad.
10/12/20, 4:04 PM - Lamba CLG: This end SARS protest has shown that united we have a voice (north south east west). So you see,we can use that voice to combat so many issues as ONE. And I think they(I mean we) are not doing it the wrong way cuz, just a day before yesterday and yesterday there was an attack in Kaduna and as a result,so many people died. That right time might not come if continue to wait for it.

10/12/20, 11:28 PM - Cupcake CLG: Once upon a time in a land called Valhalla, there was a virgin girl who also happens to be a...
A very calm and good looking....
That every man would love to call his own.
One morning, she was on her way to the market and...
And she met one handsome and hot guy
She was blushing and all flustered! He was a tall dark muscular man
But he came from a non respectable background
Ah toh 😂
No one wants to have anything to do with him or his family...
But the lady fell in love.....
A love story that wasn’t suppose to happen, after all the warning she didn’t listen until...
When something treble happens to her
She took herself to his home, all lead by infatuation! He saw the fair maiden.....
And all of a sudden, trouble aroused.
He asked her to please help him with his house chores, but little did she knows that...
The young man had his own evil......
...well planned. Instead of his house chores, he chaw her!
And the lady was shattered 
She went home in tears and......
Couldn't tell anyone that she was disvirgined in a very despicable manner....
Because of her pain, she couldn't walk home but  called her brother to drive her home,
On his way, he was stopped by police, removed his bumper and busted his Tyre...
He got so angry and started screaming at her saying she caused all this because if she didn't call him all these wouldn't have...
Happened. But little did he know the trauma she was going through; and all she did was...
Apologizing and they went home on foot then....
The policemen started searching for them! Somehow in their search of the vehicle, they had found an iPhone and a laptop......
Which he accused them of being yahoo boys.
But the brother works at smart web.
So he certainly wasn't a yahoo boy, but there was something he doesn't want anyone to find on his phone and its a video of a sex tape he made with his boss's wife now the situation is getting...
Heated. How will he explain to his sister and the police men that he has a sex video of his boss wife?
Moreover, he just finished shouting on his sister about morals!
Unfortunately they all saw the video and he was shocked 
His boss happened to be the cp of the state ....
Police command! Who happens to be their Boss's wife!!! Mogbeh! Masala have burst! They opened his wallet and saw nude pics and condoms.....
At long last they settled the matter, and he was to transfer some money to them, he didn't have cash but his friends sent him TRX currency, and just as the alrt entered, another text popped in by pecky wanting to give him a peck
While all this was going the girl was seriously in pains and in need of medical attention from the forceful entry she just experienced, now...
...the whole situation is intense. Her pains, her brothers situation and the fact that pecky is one the officers sister. 
The girl just couldn’t ...
Hold the pain anymore and she fainted. All the nearby hospitals is closed cox doctors are on strike they can't go far cox of the shortage of cash and peacky is still calling
Endless phone calls. Coincidentally, Pecky's brother asks our culprit to pick up his phone. Just as he looks at the screen, the officer sees his sister's face on the caller ID as "small chops"
The officer was raging and angry. He was about to shoot but then a cup of red roselle cocktail was offered to him to soothe his anger by ninah.
Just as he scented a sweet perfume from...
His body and knew that was the perfume of his sister, he asked him "how was the small chops you had today Hope you didn't finished it"?
But the guy couldn’t respond, because at this point he knew yawa don gas. As he try to mumble words out, the next thing he was....
Shivering and sweating but the officer whisper in his ear saying.....
Sleep is for the dead. Dey chillax small small.
Problem no dey finish for this life
He also whispered to him "zanci uwarka yau, ba kaci small chops ba? There's also big chops for you today...
And also mega chops. Amidst all these distractions, no one realize his sister wasn’t breathing anymore.
So the police...
Phone fell down that's when the officer realized she's not breathing anymore they rush her to the hospital and they can't find anymore open..
And she died.
And Endsars protest started
Now the guy that raped her started feeling guilty because he puts her in the situation that took her life, he picked up his phone and call her brother and said...
I know what I did is unforgivable, but let her dead not be in vain. Let’s organize a peaceful protest to ban the so called sars
And that's how the protest began theme "end sars"
People came out in numbers to protest. Others were selling kindirmo while others were touching bumbum inside crowd
Amidst all these the guy was still feeling guilty so he jumped in front of a moving truck and...
That brother who just lost his sister tried saving him from the truck. But unfortunately both of them...
Died. And that's how the issue got more complicated and the protest is getting worse
And that's how the shoe man was busy insulting buhari on his Twitter handle
Out of context, evicted 😂
And that's how the musician denied being part of the protest

Just trying to say that the reason for protest is already achieved and they made it clear that none of the ex SARS members will be part of the swat and the guidelines of how they will serve the country so why continue with the protest??

10/20/20, 7:02 PM - Yo: ADDRESS BY H.E. RT. HON. (DR) SIMON BAKO LALONG, KSGG TO THE CITIZENS OF PLATEAU STATE ON THE ENDSARS PROTESTS AND BREAKDOWN OF LAW AND ORDER IN JOS NORTH AND JOS SOUTH LGAs. 20TH OCTOBER 2020
1.	My dear citizens of Plateau State. I am addressing you today on the recent developments in our State following the #ENDSARS protests that have been going on across the country and in some parts of the State.
2.	Government has watched closely these protests which are normal in a democracy that guarantees the rights of citizens to ventilate their grievances over any matter.
3.	However, it is rather unfortunate that in the past few days, the #ENDSARS protests which began as peacefully have gradually degenerated to the situation where hoodlums have attacked and molested innocent citizens who are going about their normal businesses.
4.	This development took a new turn on Tuesday 20th October 2020 when the protests led to the destruction of properties, cars and looting of business premises along the Ahmadu Bello way as well as the burning of a place of worship along Gyero Road in Bukuru. In addition, three deaths have been recorded.
5.	Based on this scenario, I summoned an emergency Security Council Meeting to evaluate the situation and take decisive actions to stop further escalation. 
6.	Having received briefing from security agencies and after a careful assessment of the situation, Government is left with no choice than to impose a curfew to stop further loss of lives and properties.
7.	Accordingly, I have directed the imposition of a 24-hour curfew in Jos South and Jos North Local Government Areas with effect from 8:00 pm today Tuesday, October 20, 2020 till further notice. By this directive, all forms of protests are hereby banned in the two Local Governments Areas of Jos North and Jos South.
8.	Furthermore, all public and private businesses are to shutdown activities immediately while parents are strongly advised to rein in their children, youth and wards to forestall further breakdown of law and order. Only those on essential services will be allowed to move around to their duty posts.
9.	Security agencies have been directed to ensure that the curfew is enforced as defaulters will be arrested and prosecuted. 
10.	While the Government of Plateau State concedes to the constitutional rights of its citizens to undertake legitimate protests, it cannot sit and watch hoodlums take the law into their hands to cause mayhem on innocent citizens and the entire State.
11.	I wish to reiterate the resolve of our administration in working assiduously to maintain the peace that the people of the State have laboured hard to build over the years. 
12.	Let me again call on the protesters to pursue the path of constructive engagement and dialogue since the Government has started implementing their demands.
13.	Only yesterday, I inaugurated the Judicial Panel of Inquiry on police brutality and other related extra-judicial killings in Plateau State, headed by Justice Philomena Lot, a retired Judge of the High Court of Plateau State. This was also followed by strategic engagement with different groups and organisations.
14.	As the panel prepares to commence its sitting, it will be helpful for all those who have complaints against members of the disbanded SARS and other police units to take their complaints to the panel for necessary action. Our administration will also do everything possible to implement the outcome of the panel’s recommendation as it applies to its jurisdiction. 
15.	Fellow citizens, these are difficult times that call for unity and understanding which is needed to enable us overcome the current challenges in our march to nationhood. We have to stand together and avoid any act that could jeopardize our collective existence and the future of our children.  
16.	As your Governor, my administration shall continue to support the agitation for a wholistic reform of the policing architecture in our country as well as advocate for further reforms towards the rapid implementation of community policing which I have strongly canvassed for.
17.	Plateau State cannot afford to slide back to the days of crisis which we have substantially put behind us thanks to the collective efforts of all citizens, security agencies and relevant stakeholders.
18.	God bless Plateau State and the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
19.	Thank you.
Rt. Hon. (Dr.) Simon Bako Lalong, KSGG.
Executive Governor, Plateau State
20th October 2020.

Please be safe wherever you are and don’t forget to be cautious of your surroundings.
It’s a phase and it will be over soon;
Don’t panic just pray,

May God shield and keep us safe through this time and beyond Amen 🙏🏾 
Stay safe ❤️
I love you so much 🥺🥺😔❤️

10/21/20, 10:04 AM - Kim CLG: What nonsense
10/21/20, 10:05 AM - Kim CLG: All of them are Northerners and Hausas. Exactly what I was saying here last night.

Hope everyone is safe.
Please stay safe!
10/21/20, 10:33 AM - Ahmad Pablo El Jefe: @2348163262744 the reason I have said anything on Twitter since yesterday was to avoid such people.
Just calm down and allow them yarn trash
10/21/20, 10:38 AM - Kim CLG: Bro they're spoiling our names ne
10/21/20, 10:40 AM - Kim CLG: You know the kind of energy we put to get to this stage. If you look at CLG as a small example is enough to fight such people
10/21/20, 10:40 AM - Kim CLG: There's nothing like Ethnicity or religion here. We all speak with one voice
10/21/20, 10:41 AM - Kim CLG: @2348066141604 was trapped yesterday at the bank and the whole CLG was on fire till he got home.
10/21/20, 10:43 AM - Kim CLG: That's the Nigeria we want bro.
10/21/20, 10:43 AM - Kim CLG: I will never tolerate any negative post from anybody bearing Muslim name.
10/21/20, 10:44 AM - Ahmad Pablo El Jefe: One thing is that I am happy and proud of the people in this group.
We know we are a family and lookout for each other.

You won't understand what we are built on here except if you don't come closer to us.

What matters most is staying together, and we as a family here, I can guarantee we have that in our hearts.
10/21/20, 10:46 AM - Ahmad Pablo El Jefe: But the people outside this place, won't know, and would want to tarnish our own images.

Remember when SazK did the thing on we the jos Muslims, we all stood up against him and he never did that again.

Slowly and carefully, we'll do that everyone that isn't united at heart and tell them we are different set of people.
10/21/20, 10:46 AM - Ahmad Pablo El Jefe: I just wish the people around us will have knowledge and understand.
10/21/20, 10:47 AM - Kim CLG: Ameen

10/21/20, 2:34 PM - Ahmad Pablo El Jefe: REMARKS BY H.E. SIMON BAKO LALONG, EXECUTIVE GOVERNOR OF PLATEAU STATE AT A STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT WITH TRADITIONAL RULERS, COMMUNITY LEADERS AND PIDAN ON DEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO ENDSARS PROTESTS IN PLATEAU STATE HELD AT GOVERNMENT HOUSE LITTLE RAYFIELD JOS ON 21ST OCTOBER 2020.
PROTOCOLS
1. It has become necessary to invite you here for this strategic engagement over recent developments in our State and the country at large owing to what is widely known as the ENDSARS protests.

2. You will recall that I declared a 24 hours curfew in Jos South and Jos North Local Government Areas yesterday because the #ENDSARS protest which began peacefully was gradually degenerating into chaos as hoodlums attacked and molested innocent citizens who were going about their normal businesses.

3. This development took a new turn yesterday when the protests led to the destruction of properties, cars and looting of business premises along the Ahmadu Bello way as well as the burning of a place of worship along Gyero Road in Bukuru. In addition, three deaths were recorded.

4. As a result of this, I summoned an emergency Security Council Meeting to evaluate the situation and take decisive actions to stop further escalation. 
Having received briefing from security agencies and after a careful assessment of the situation, Government was left with no choice than to impose a curfew to stop further loss of lives and properties.
5. This action does not in anyway negate the constitutional right of citizens to undertake legitimate and peaceful protests. However, when such protests turn violent or are hijacked by miscreants and people with other motives, no responsible Government will sit by and watch innocent citizens being terrorized.

6. I wish to reiterate the resolve of our administration in working assiduously to maintain the peace that the people of the State have laboured hard to build over the years. 

7. As collaborators and partners in our inclusive governance architecture, l have once again convened this interface to update you and equally solicit for your input as to the way forward in consolidating on the calm atmosphere that has been restored in the affected areas. Peace is a priceless commodity that we cannot do without.

8. From the crisis that this State and its people have witnessed in previous years, we have to do everything possible to ensure that those dark days do not return. As traditional, community, and religious leaders, you have a great role to play.

9. I am therefore directing you to take lawful measures to ensure that there is no breakdown of law and order in your domains. Government shall hold you accountable for any breach of the peace if you fail to take necessary steps to maintain peace.

10. You should engage and sensitise your people to the fact that violence has no place in the new Plateau that we are nurturing. Rather than embarking on the destruction of lives and properties at the slightest provocation, there are legitimate avenues to ventilate grievances in a democracy.

11. I also appeal to parents to talk to their children and advise them to calm down and embrace the path of dialogue and engagement while shunning violence. Those who have legitimate grievances should be advised to explore available channels including the courts to ventilate them.

12. Earlier, the protesters had presented a 5-point demand to the Government for the disbandment of SARS; Punishment of culprits; Compensation for victims; Setting of panels to investigate all atrocities and improving the welfare of the police.

13. Government has begun implementing their requests with the dissolution of SARS. On Monday, I inaugurated the Judicial Panel of Inquiry on police brutality and other related extra-judicial killings in Plateau State, headed by Justice Philomena Lot, a retired Judge of the High Court of Plateau State. 

14. This Judicial Commission of Inquiry is to receive and hear complaints from all victims who have any complaint against the disbanded SARS and other police units with the view to ensuring that they obtain justice.

15. As the panel prepares to commence its sitting, it will be better for the youths to direct their energies to the panel of inquiry in order to have their cases investigated so that they can obtain justice. That way, government will continue to address the other issues raised by the protesters as fast as possible.

16. Let me assure our citizens that our administration will also do everything possible to implement the outcome of the panel’s recommendation as it applies to its jurisdiction. 
17. Like I have stated elsewhere, the atrocities by some members of the scrapped Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) are horrific and condemnable. They remind us of the urgency for a wholistic reform of the policing architecture in the country so as to better protect the lives and properties of our people.
18. We need to have a policing architecture that is community-driven and manned by people of integrity who will be equipped, motivated and paid well to perform their duties with passion, compassion and honesty. They must earn the trust of the people and operate based on intelligence.

19. As Governor, I will also continue to advocate for further reforms towards the rapid implementation of community policing which I have strongly advocated for. Plateau State is one of the pilot States in the implementation of this initiative.

20. I wish to once again appreciate you for your continuous support to the Government in ensuring that we build a peaceful and prosperous Plateau. We have to remain resolute at times like this which we shall soon put behind us.

21. Government will continue with these pragmatic steps of strategic engagement with different stakeholders at various levels to ensure that citizens are carried along as we march forward in the task of building a virile plateau of our dream.

22. God bless Plateau State and the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

23. Thank you.

Rt. Hon. (Dr.) Simon Bako Lalong, KSGG.
Executive Governor, Plateau State
21st October 2020.

10/22/20, 2:06 PM - Ninah CLG: PRESS RELEASE

PLATEAU STATE GOVERNOR RELAXES CURFEW

Following resolutions reached at a high level stakeholders’ meeting chaired by the Executive Governor of Plateau State, Rt. Hon. Simon Bako Lalong, one of which is the need for stakeholders to immediately engage their communities across the state in a systematic Peace dialogues aimed at de-escalating tension, the Government has decided to relax the curfew earlier imposed on Jos North and South Local Government Areas from 6am to 8pm as from Friday October 23, 2020 until further notice.

This decision was reached after painstaking deliberations with critical stakeholders and careful assessment of the security situation that led to the skirmishes in some parts of the affected local government areas, last Tuesday. 
Please note that the government is not unmindful of citizens’ Constitutional Rights to hold lawful assembly or stage peaceful protests as long as these are carried out within the extant laws of Nigeria. As a Government, we also appreciate the fact that these are the variables that further deepen our democracy.

However, as a deliberate approach to prevent a repeat of last Tuesday’s ugly incident where precious human lives and property were lost, the Government has for now also resolved to ban forthwith any processions and protests under whatever guise in order to safeguard the lives all citizens of the state. This is to enable the Government isolate and deal with those who are bent on disrupting the peace of the State. 

By this notice, we urge all law abiding citizens to go about their legitimate businesses without fear of molestation as government has put all necessary measures in place to ensure the maintenance of law and order across the state. 
For the avoidance of doubt, the Plateau State government has already set machinery in motion to address the demands raised by the protesters. In this light, government has constituted a Committee headed by a retired High Court Judge, Justice Philomena Lot which has since swung into action and ready to receive petitions from those who have cases.
We sue for understanding and patience from all and sundry as government takes decisive steps to address the demands of the protesters in the coming weeks.

We therefore call on all citizens to avoid any action that is inimical to the overall development of the state especially those that threaten the peace and unity of our people. 
Signed. 
Prof. Danladi A. Atu
Secretary to the Government of the State

10/24/20, 1:00 PM - Yo: PRESS STATEMENT 

PLATEAU GOVERNMENT DENIES HOARDING PALLIATIVES

Following the vandalization and looting of palliatives from some warehouses in Jos and Bukuru on 24th October 2020, it has become expedient for the Plateau State Government to condemn the action and further make some clarirications about the items to clear the erroenous impression that they were being hoarded. 

The items at the warehouses were delivered to the state by the  Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Social Development and Disaster Management for distribution to beneficiaries in Plateau State. 

The public may recall that the Hon. Minister of Humanitarian Affairs Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouk was in Jos together with the Minister of Women Affairs Dame Paullen Tallen on the 16th October 2020 to deliver the items and had indeed brought in the personel of the Ministry to carry out the distribution in conjunction with State officials. However as they were preparing to begin the process, the #ENDSARS protests began which put the process on hold.

Unfortunately while the team from the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Social Development and Disaster Management alongside the state representatives were waiting for the coast to clear to commence the distribution, the stores were breached and the items carted away.

The Plateau State Government therefore wishes to state categorically that it did not hoard any palliatives meant for the citizens of the State at any time. All the palliatives purchased by the State and those donated by private individuals were distributed equitably by the State Palliative Committee headed by His Excellency Prof. Sonni Tyoden, Deputy Governor of Plateau State. 

With this explanation, it would be wrong and mischievous for anyone to suggest that the State Government was hoarding food items meant for indigent citizens. The Rescue Administration of Governor Simon Lalong will never tolerate that.

Government wishes to once again appeal to the citizens particularly the youths to continue to conduct themselves peacefully and avoid any action that could cause the breakdown of law and order.

The Government wishes to remind citizens that directive for the ban on protests and procession is still in force and security agencies still have the mandate to arrest and prosecute those who violate the order.

Lets always Think and Act Plateau!

10/24/20, 2:53 PM - Yo: RE-INSTAINMENT OF 24-HOUR CURFEW IN JOS SOUTH JOS AND NORTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREAS.
Fellow citizens of Plateau State, you will recall that I announced a 24-hour curfew in Jos South and Jos North Local Government Areas on 20th October 2020 in response to the disturbances that arose when hoodlums hijacked the ENDSARS protests leading to the destruction of lives and properties. 
After an assessment of the situation, the curfew was relaxed from the hours of 6am to 8pm from yesterday 23rd October 2020.
However today, some hoodlums broke into the warehouses where palliatives delivered to the State by the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development last week were stored awaiting distribution and carted them away.
This looting has spread to other facilities and is gradually degenerating thereby threatening the peace and security of the State. 
To avoid further escalation, I hereby direct the immediate reinstatement of the 24-hour curfew earlier relaxed from 4pm today 24th October 2020 in Jos South and Jos North Local Government Areas till further notice.
By this, security agencies are directed to enforce the curfew and ensure that all violators are arrested and prosecuted.  
I call on all citizens and stakeholders to continue to cooperate with Government in ensuring the peace and progress of Plateau State. 

Rt. Hon. (Dr.) Simon Bako Lalong
Executive Governor of Plateau State.

10/26/20, 8:55 AM - Kim CLG: THE PROGRESSION OF WAR, FAMINE AND DEATH.

I really hope all these people cheering what is going on presently in Nigeria understands the trend of war..
 It is always a trend.. From Libya to Syria to Yemen to CAR to Somalia to Liberia to Sierra Leone to Ivory Coast to Rwanda.. It is always the same way, the same trend and stages.. 

Here are the stages:

PLOT 1... People rise up to protest.

PLOT 2... The Government repressed  protesters. Soldiers fired live ammunition into crowd killing protesters. 

PLOT 3... Mob retaliated and burnt down government and political leader's assumed assets. 

PLOT 4... Army and police withdrew due to international pressure to guard their own barracks only. 

PLOT 5. The mob went after assets and houses of prominent political leaders. Then politicians fled abroad with their families. 

PLOT 6... The mob went after assets and lives of the middle class or anyone that has semblance of wealth or comfort.. 
Estate housing and other middle class were attacked.
Then it degenerated to the lower classes, it became a full scale crime wave, robbery, looting, rape, murder etc.
it became the survival of the fittest.
Remember no more police or army to protect them. 

PLOT 7... Full scale war as opportunists with group interests and ego took over, competing over interests and end up tearing the country apart. 

PLOT 8... People flee their homes. Became refugees as they flee the country in thousands and millions to become beggars in neighbouring and other countries. Many died to famine and diseases.

PLOT 9... This is no more the 1960s.. The internal wars will be a reoccurring decima with no uniting force - 
People's children and young men will be recruited as child soldiers.. The old and feeble will be killed and the women raped and eventually killed when deemed of no use.
Remember the Libya scenario. 

I hope we are all praying. 
All those houses, possessions families and loved ones could disappear in a twinkle of an eye. 
Those people abroad blowing the flames of violence will remain abroad eating Kentucky fried chicken in U.S, UK etc. and UN will turn a blind eye, except for a few UN peace keepers kept in one expensive hotel - Remember hotel Rwanda. 

What we all need is prayer, not only for Nigeria, but for yourself and your families.. 
The name Nigeria may disappear and we all bear our family names.. 
The Billions, Millions or Thousands of Naira in the bank will be more worthless than toilet roll..

AS AT THE WRITING OF THIS ON 21/10/20... WE ARE PRESENTLY AT STAGE 5 IN NIGERIA NOW... IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO END IT.

SAY NO TO ANARCHY
SAY NO TO VIOLENCE
SAY NO TO LOOTING
SAY NOT TO BURNING
SAY NO TO ANYTHING THAT DOES NOT PROMOTE PEACE.

Share this.. it may just help to change someone's mind to embrace peace.The progression is frightening and those who will first hightail are the ones fanning the embers and spreading divisive communiques.

PLATEAU STATE SECURITY COUNCIL MEETS OVER LOOTING AND CURFEW
The Plateau State Security Council has again met to deliberate on the security situation following the massive looting that has been perpetrated across the State in the last two days.
Briefing newsmen after the meeting held at Government House Rayfield Jos, Secretary to the Government of the State Prof. Danladi Atu said so far, the situation is calm but still fluid as there are still threats to attack other public and private businesses as well as individuals.
He said the Council agreed to further fortify all check-points in Jos South and Jos North Local Government Areas to give effect to the curfew imposed in order to restore peace that will determine the next line of action.
He also said that security agencies have been mandated to embark on massive manhunt for the arrest of looters and ensure materials are recovered while the culprits are prosecuted.
Prof. Atu said so far, 7 courts have been designated for the prosecution of the 307 suspects so far arrested at various locations where the looting took place.
The Council warned members of the public from consuming some of the looted food items because they are dangerous for human consumption as they have been chemically treated for preservation.
Members of the public were further advised to be aware of these dangers and not to patronize the product of these looters.
The Council also encouraged the sustenance of all channels of engagement and dialogue with youth groups, community leaders, professional bodies, associations and traditional rulers to foster more understanding that will lead to a de-escalation of the current situation.
Members of the security forces were commended for their efforts so far and encouraged to continue to work in restoring and maintaining peace in the State. The Government has also promised to look into their challenges with a view to addressing them and making them more effective.
The Government again restated that there was no hoarding of palliatives as the looted items were delivered to the State by the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development just before the #ENDSARS protests began which made it difficult for the distribution to commence before the sad looting and destruction of the warehouses.
The council advised members of the public to be wary of propaganda and disinformation that is perpetrated through the social media to incite the people against government and encourage chaos, saying no society can exist without law and order.
Council notes that up till now, some political leaders and traditional rulers have not engaged their people as resolved with at the stakeholders meeting with the Governor. They are being called upon to do so and submit reports to government immediately.
As at 26th October 2020, some of the looted and vandalized properties include: SEMA Warehouse (Old Nitel Bukuru), PRUWASSA, PADP (Dogon Dutse Jos), Mineral Museum (Angul D, Bukuru), ASTC Vom, Plateau Publishing Company, SUBEB (Dogon Dutse), Government Technical College Bukuru, Ryom Local Government Secretariat, School of Home Economics Vom, Jos foods, Jos Trade Fair (Polo), Private Residence of former Speaker, Rt. Hon. Yakubu Dogara. Others such as Grand Cereals Bukuru, State and Federal Secretariats and Private residences of some individuals have also been threatened.

Dr. Makut Simon Macham
Director of Press & Public Affairs to the Governor of Plateau State.
